# Examples of API Tests for Fake Store API on TypeScript

This repository contains a suite of tests for the Fake Store API. It is designed as an educational example to demonstrate and practice various testing technologies and methodologies using TypeScript.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: A strongly-typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.
- **Mocha**: Test framework that provides a flexible testing structure.
- **Chai**: Assertion library for writing clear and expressive tests.
- **Winston**: Logging library for recording test execution details.
- **Cucumber**: Tool for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), allowing tests to be written in a readable format.

## Objectives

- **Learn and practice TypeScript**: Gain experience in TypeScript, a modern language that enhances JavaScript with type safety.
- **Implement API testing**: Utilize Axios for HTTP requests and Mocha/Chai for creating and asserting tests.
- **Employ BDD principles**: Write test scenarios using Cucumber to follow a behavior-driven development methodology.
- **Log and debug effectively**: Use Winston for detailed logging to trace and troubleshoot test execution.
